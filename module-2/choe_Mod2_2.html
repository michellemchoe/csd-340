        <h2>Introducing Michelle</h2>

        <p class="intro"> My name is Michelle Choe. I am a developer working on my Bachelors degree in software development. My favorite part about coding is finding creative solutions to problems.</p>
        <p> I currently reside in Orange Country, California. I live with my sister and my two cats. While I am in school, I work as a server to support myself. <span class="sentence">The restaurant I work at is flexible enough to work with my school schedule.</span></p>
        <p> I have a very large family. I am the fourth of five daughters. We are all still very close. </p>
        <p> In my spare time, I enjoy tending to my houseplants. I have an extesive collection that feels out of hand at times. Luckily, I have somethings automated to make things easier.</p>
